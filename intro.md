```{tab-item} Things I Learned
- I learned about Jupyter Book and the possible uses it can have with online content
- I developed greater familiarity with Markdown and how it can be used with Jupyter Book and Jupyter Lab
- I learned more about the use and flexibility of GitHub
```
```{tab-item} Things I Found Difficult
- I find it difficult to understand if I have done something correctly when I don't have a visual example to compare with for tasks that there has been no previous instruction on.
- I am still a bit unclear as to how the file structure should be set up for the book and if it should mimic usual best practice i.e. images/*.png in with the build or external.
```
```{tab-item} Thanks!
- This course was very informative as I was not familiar with any of the tools other than Jupyter Notebook. I also appreciate the flexibility with deadlines.
